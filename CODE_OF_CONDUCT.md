# Code of Conduct

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Statz community.

This project is all about learning, building cool system-monitoring tools, and having fun doing it. To keep things respectful, inclusive, and productive for everyone, we’ve got a few ground rules.

## 🌟 TL;DR

Be chill. Be kind. Don’t be a jerk. Help others when you can. We’re all here to grow.

## 📜 The Rules

### 1. Respect everyone
Treat others how you'd want to be treated. No hate speech, harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks. Not cool, not allowed.

### 2. Keep it safe for all
No NSFW, offensive, or intentionally disruptive content. Let’s keep the community a vibe everyone can enjoy.

### 3. Be constructive
Feedback is awesome—just keep it helpful and respectful. If someone’s code sucks, tell them *why* and *how* to fix it, not just that it sucks.

### 4. No spam or self-promo
Keep things relevant to the project. Don’t drop random links, ads, or self-promo unless it’s actually helpful to others in context.

### 5. Embrace beginners
Everyone starts somewhere. Be patient, explain things, and celebrate learning moments—no gatekeeping allowed.

### 6. Report issues respectfully
Bugs happen. If you find one, open an issue or PR with as much detail as possible. Don’t just say “it doesn’t work” and disappear like a ghost.

### 7. Ask for help nicely
We’re all volunteers here. If you need help, that’s totally fine! Just be chill and respectful about it.
